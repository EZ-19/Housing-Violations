# Montgomery County Housing-Violations
This is a website designed to show visualization of information pertaining to Montgomery County housing violations.

The website first generates a subset of housing violations to show overall data. The user can then generate a random set of 15 housing violation cases from which to visualize the data. Finally, the user can enter text to filter the list of 15 down to whichever address matches the text the user searches.
